# JavaFX-with-MySQL
Demonstrating how to connect to a MySQL database from JavaFX app

This was created to learn how to connect to MySQL from a JavaFX program.
The basic idea comes from having an app for an EFL school. When a new student
joins the school you can add them to your database. The full implementation
of all functions such as delete, update, etc hasn't been implemented in this
app. However, they have been tested as well. I found this a very useful experience
to gain knowledge of building databases and how to connect with them.
